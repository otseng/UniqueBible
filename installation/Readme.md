# Installation

There are various ways to install UniqueBible.app.

Basically, you can simply need to download UBA and run it if you have Python and git in place.

Below is an outline for a fresh installation:

1) Install Python and git

2) Download UBA

3) Run UBA

# Automatic Setup

To make installation easier, we have a script in place to automate the following elements:

1) Set up a virtual environment to run UBA, so to avoid any potential conflict with other python-based software / projects on your device.

2) All dependencies required (listed at: https://github.com/eliranwong/UniqueBible/blob/master/requirements.txt)

3) Creation of application shortcut

4) Download of initial content

5) Special tweaks for particular platform, e.g. Chrome OS

One-off automatic setup is done the first time you run UBA.

You don't need to worry about downloading lots of packages yourself.

# Download resources

Subsequent download of resouces is based on your demand.

When you select a new feature, UBA asks you if you want to install extra resources in case some files are not yet installed.

You can also import tons of third-party resources, created for many different third-party softwares in Unique Bible App.

Therefore, you can have all the best resources centralised in UBA.
