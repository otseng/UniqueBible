# Use Virtual Keyboard

You have an option to use virtual keyboards for typing.

Virtual keyboards are useful for touch-screen users.  It may also facilitate input of Hebrew, Greek or other non-English characters on systems, where non-English keyboards are not installed.

To enable built-in virtual keyboards, edit file "config.py" with a text editor.

<b>ATTENTION:</b> Close UniqueBible.app first before you edit file "config.py".  Otherwise, your changes may be overwritten later by the app upon closing.  Re-open the app only after you edit and save the changes in "config.py".

Change the option "virtualKeyboard" FROM:

> virtualKeyboard = False

TO:

> virtualKeyboard = True

<b>Remarks:</b> You need to close the virtual keyboard before you can close the app.  You can use the button located at the right lower corner of the virtual keyboard to close it.
